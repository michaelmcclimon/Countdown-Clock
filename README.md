# Countdown-Clock
I just recently earned my JavaScript Programming for Blockchain Developer certificate!
I want to display my newfound skills with this code I have been writing.
Building a countdown clock to the last Bitcoin being mined seemed appropriate. 

# Html
Working on the HTML I used all standard formatting. I kept things simple by adding a picture of myself for familiarity.


# CSS
Here I wanted to align everything up because it is only one page. 
I decided to center everything. Thats why I used text-align center for the <p> and the <img & <a(link).
  
  
# JavaScript
This was the main focus of the project to display the skills I have programming in JavaScript.
I used functions for the days, hours, minutes, and seconds so it would be in a continuous loop. 
The "estimated" date I used was Jan 5, 2140, 15:55:35. This is said to be when the last bitcoin will be mined.
This is an estimate because they may work on or change the protocol down the road.
I added Elements to the page via the document.getElementById like the Clock.


# Conclusion 
This was a fun small first project with JavaScript. 
I look forward to working in the program more and learning as much as I can over the next few months.
